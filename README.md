## Foreword
#### What is a cognitive basis?
First of all - regarding terminology used, let's set the core declaration here. The phrase 'cognitive basis' is not a standard expression in neurobiology or psychology domains, but [in my opinion](#Motivation) one can construct a meaningful explanation by combining concepts from both cognitive science and linear algebra.

**Primary declaration: Cognitive Basis - 'a set of orthogonal, interpretable dimensions linearly decomposing cognitive processes’**

*Alternative wording: a 'cognitive basis' can be understood as a set of fundamental cognitive structures or processes that serve as the building blocks for more complex cognitive functions.* 
*Just as a basis in linear algebra provides a set of vectors that can span a vector space, a cognitive basis provides a set of basic cognitive elements that can be combined to explain a wide range of cognitive phenomena.*

For this specific cognitive basis each axis/dimension:
- Encodes a primitive cognitive function with short description and operational verbs
- Maps into implementable activities and examples like scientific research stages and RPG stats for gamification of daily life
- Limits [symbolism](#Symbolism) to metaphors and archetypical links only (no pseudo-science!)

#### Why 7-axis?
There are 7 days of week - near-universal cultural artifact rooted in the naked-eye observation of celestial bodies. Aside of that, this number has scientifically sound reasons - one of the most cited articles in psychology[^1] ironically plays with it's "magical" nature rooted in our human capacity for processing information.
#### How to use this repository?
On a practical note, the repo has two main goals: 
- **(A)** introduce development of a particular cognitive basis to the community
- **(B)** serve as a template for a Knowledge Management System in the form of Obsidian Vault

> [!TIP]
> **If you just want to have an Obsidian vault set up and running**
> 1. Download this repo as zip
> 2. Unpack it where you want your vault to be located
> 3. Run Obsidian
> 	- If you have another vault already open -> click `Manage vaults...`
> 4. `Open folder as vault` -> navigate to the location of unzipped repo
> 5. Use this cognitive basis to organize your notes or adjust it to your taste! 

> [!NOTE]
> **If you using GitHub (for syncing your vault)**
> 1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository
> 2. Above the file list, click **Use this template**
> 3. Select **Create a new repository**

## Symbolism 
The whole project is very much an attempt of philosophical reflection, so it should be taken with a grain of rational salt. Some argumentation may be rather subjective - constructive criticism is very welcomed in GitHub Discussions!
> [!CAUTION]
> **Disclaimer**
> 
> Professional employment at scientific research institutes and programming/engineering experience shaped me to reject any smell of pseudo-science. Thus, a more objective part presented above should be considered the cognitive basis core.
> Symbolism presented in the section below is a particularly tricky part as it contains much more subjective view dictated by my innate passion for learning languages and cultures outside my native one. Being a significant part of my personal cognition, it obviously affected development of this basis. However, it should be viewed as a supplementary information - useful to better understand minor reasoning factors, but avoiding unnecessary overreaching.

## Motivation
> [!NOTE]
> **Foreword from the initial draft human author (Sergei Abramenkov, PhD)**
> 
> Various math courses I had to take during university education did not get stuck in my head as fully and clearly as I would prefer. Still, I was really affected by a single simple idea presented throughout the major part of mathematics. To me it became the most important principle way beyond math itself - it formed my outlook on any complex problem in general. Underlying concept for this principle/idea is called ***basis*** and that is exactly as it presented in [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)): **a set of axis in a vector space that allows its elements to be written as a finite linear combination of these axis unit vectors**.
>
> The root philosophical idea of making a personal cognitive basis had sparked during the second year of my postgraduate studies (late 2016). After years of struggling I somehow extracted it into the digital form and drafted 7 primary axis for my personal cognitive basis. Essentially I iteratively sorted and resorted out key actions, directions and dimensions of day to day life experience, then arranged it on a foundation of physics metaphors and linear algebra concepts. While I tried my best to keep the obtained cognitive basis vectors rather universal - this whole system is still very much subjective.
> Finally (only recently), I discovered that a Large Language Model (LLM) may help immensely with the daunting task of organizing raw thoughts formed by human natural intelligence into concise and beautiful form. So together with **DeepSeek-V3**[^2] we co-designing an updated and much more coherent system presented here. 
### What's next?
Each axis has a role / archetype baked in with an attribute that can be widely applicable. Like a non-typical RPG* with 7 stats system *(VACUITY)*, or gamification of time-management in daily life, or (think of it!) key parameters for 7 agents forming a cognitive engine architecture with physics-based constrains! The elegance here lies in blending of intuitive graspable archetypes with potential for AI layer computational primitives. All this is dangerously scalable** with, examples like creating a cognitive matrix of interaction between these fundamental axis, or simply feeding this basis to LLM as a pre-context prompt. But most importantly it can inspire you to better structure you own human thoughts! I least for it was game-changing in terms of productivity:)

*P.S. Nod to Disco Elysium game mechanics with my deepest respect to people who designed it)* 

*P.P.S. I'm open for hiring by a leading AI/ML lab - contact me if you interested:)* 

### Contribute 
> [!TIP]
> Since it is a GitHub template repo you can just use it to create your own fresh repository with a single commit history and all existing folder structure and few files like this README. 
> However if you want to contribute you are welcome to fork, make a branch and pull-request as usual, since it is still a GitHub repo after all. 
> I intend to make few branches that for example include specific Obsidian files like a custom css-theme.

If you found any ideas in this project worthy - do not hesitate, let me know what resonated! If you have decent confidence of what can be added/removed/modified - feel free to contribute to the template (but make sure to create a new branch before pull-request)!

+ [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vQs5NB9WC_ceyZGvH8e-WtEDKA_uy5MAT5-RcDc3EtY/edit?usp=sharing) - I'm working on updating it but the core editing is done in this repository with Obsidian.
+ [Video](https://rutube.ru/video/51ae33308ca712e83ca291cf8436471a/) of my talk titled "Co-designing with LLM: a personalized cognitive engine architecture" presented @ [Data Fest 2025](https://ods.ai/events/fest2025-koronatech-nsk/schedule). The talk was given in English with rather decent grammar and vocabulary but I failed to deliver "The Why?" to the audience and overall flow was not very good. Also, slides in the talk are slightly outdated but the core essence remains the same. 

+ [Seven Dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI-FS7aZJpY) - a video-essay by Kieran Borovac on YouTube that I highly recommend to get a reason behind anchoring cognitive axis to physical dimensions.
