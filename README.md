## Foreword

### Where can I use this RPG system? 🎮
The VACUITY RPG system is designed to be a foundational layer for structuring thought and action. I primarily use it as a *narrative framework for gamified cognition*. Each axis has a role / archetype baked in with an attribute that can be widely applicable. The elegance here lies in blending of intuitive graspable archetypes with potential for AI layer computational primitives. Here are some examples how you can use it right now!
+ **In Personal Productivity:** Transform your daily to-do list into a quest log. Instead of "write report," you embark on a `Generation` quest to `prototype` a draft, followed by a `Revelation` quest to `analyse` and refine it. Your `Cognitive Load (CL)` is your stamina bar.  
+ **In Creative Writing & Worldbuilding:** Use the axes as a character development tool. A character's stats (`Vit`, `Apl`, `Com`, etc.) dictate how they approach problems. A high-`Inv`, low-`Tem` character might be a brilliant but reckless inventor, prone to `over-grown` idea sprawl.
+ **In AI Agent Architecture:** This is perhaps the most potent future application. Each axis can define a specialized module or "cognitive primitive" for an AI. The RPG attributes (`Vit`, `Apl`, etc.) can be adjustable parameters that govern the agent's behaviour, creating a transparent and interpretable architecture for complex reasoning.
Most importantly it can inspire you to maybe invent a better system or at least step on the path to structure you own human thoughts! At least for me it was game-changing in terms of productivity:)

### What is a cognitive basis? 💭
First of all - regarding terminology used, let's set the core declaration here. The phrase 'cognitive basis' is not a standard expression in neurobiology or psychology domains, but [in my opinion](#Motivation) one can construct a meaningful explanation by combining concepts from both cognitive science and linear algebra.

**Primary declaration: Cognitive Basis - 'a set of orthogonal, interpretable dimensions linearly decomposing cognitive processes’**

*Alternative wording: a 'cognitive basis' can be understood as a set of fundamental cognitive structures or processes that serve as the building blocks for more complex cognitive functions.* 
*Just as a basis in linear algebra provides a set of vectors that can span a vector space, a cognitive basis provides a set of basic cognitive elements that can be combined to explain a wide range of cognitive phenomena.*

For this specific cognitive basis each axis/dimension:
+ Encodes a primitive cognitive function with short description and operational verbs
+ Maps into implementable activities and examples like scientific research stages and RPG stats for gamification of daily life
+ Limits [symbolism](#Symbolism) to metaphors and archetypical links only (no pseudo-science!)
#### Why 7-axis?
There are 7 days of week - near-universal cultural artifact rooted in the naked-eye observation of celestial bodies. Aside of that, this number has scientifically sound reasons - one of the most cited articles in psychology[^1] ironically plays with it's "magical" nature rooted in our human capacity for processing information.

+ **RPG attribute = [yielding (`Yld`)](#yielding)**

## Symbolism 
The whole project is very much an attempt of philosophical reflection, so it should be taken with a grain of rational salt. Some argumentation may be rather subjective - constructive criticism is very welcomed in GitHub Discussions!
> [!CAUTION]
> **Disclaimer**
> 
> Professional employment at scientific research institutes and programming/engineering experience shaped me to reject any smell of pseudo-science. Thus, a more objective part presented above should be considered the cognitive basis core.
> Symbolism presented in the section below is a particularly tricky part as it contains much more subjective view dictated by my innate passion for learning languages and cultures outside my native one. Being a significant part of my personal cognition, it obviously affected development of this basis. However, it should be viewed as a supplementary information - useful to better understand minor reasoning factors, but avoiding unnecessary overreaching.

## Motivation
> [!NOTE]
> **Foreword from the initial draft human author (Sergei Abramenkov, PhD)**
> 
> Various math courses I had to take during university education did not get stuck in my head as fully and clearly as I would prefer. Still, I was really affected by a single simple idea presented throughout the major part of mathematics. To me it became the most important principle way beyond math itself - it formed my outlook on any complex problem in general. Underlying concept for this principle/idea is called ***basis*** and that is exactly as it presented in [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)): **a set of axis in a vector space that allows its elements to be written as a finite linear combination of these axis unit vectors**.
>
> The root philosophical idea of making a personal cognitive basis had sparked during the second year of my postgraduate studies (late 2016). After years of struggling I somehow extracted it into the digital form and drafted 7 primary axis for my personal cognitive basis. Essentially I iteratively sorted and resorted out key actions, directions and dimensions of day to day life experience, then arranged it on a foundation of physics metaphors and linear algebra concepts. While I tried my best to keep the obtained cognitive basis vectors rather universal - this whole system is still very much subjective.
> Finally (only recently), I discovered that a Large Language Model (LLM) may help immensely with the daunting task of organising raw thoughts formed by human natural intelligence into concise and beautiful form. So together with **DeepSeek-V3**[^2] we have co-designed an updated and much more coherent system presented here.

> However if you want to contribute you are welcome to fork, make a branch and pull-request as usual, since it is still a GitHub repo after all. 
> I intend to make few branches that for example include specific Obsidian files like a custom css-theme.

If you found any ideas in this project worthy - do not hesitate, let me know what resonated! If you have decent confidence of what can be added/removed/modified - feel free to contribute to the template (but make sure to create a new branch before pull-request)!

+ [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vQs5NB9WC_ceyZGvH8e-WtEDKA_uy5MAT5-RcDc3EtY/edit?usp=sharing) - I'm working on updating it but the core editing is done in this repository with Obsidian.
+ [Video](https://rutube.ru/video/51ae33308ca712e83ca291cf8436471a/) of my talk titled "Co-designing with LLM: a personalised cognitive engine architecture" presented @ [Data Fest 2025](https://ods.ai/events/fest2025-koronatech-nsk/schedule). The talk was given in English with rather decent grammar and vocabulary but I failed to deliver "The Why?" to the audience and overall flow was not very good. Also, slides in the talk are slightly outdated but the core essence remains the same. 

+ [Seven Dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI-FS7aZJpY) - a video-essay by Kieran Borovac on YouTube that I highly recommend to get a reason behind anchoring cognitive axis to physical dimensions.
